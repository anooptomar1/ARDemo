# ARDemo

Create an AR Project with ARKit. Explored Tracking, Plane Detection, Hit Testing, Light Estimation, SCNNode Rendering etc.

- If you want to enable Plane Detection, just remove the comment out code //configuration.planeDetection = .horizontal in "ARViewController"

- Adding the Feature "Real World Path Direction" by tapping on Map. GoogleMap will give us the direction to that location from user location
then click on "ARView" & you will get the real-world path direction.
